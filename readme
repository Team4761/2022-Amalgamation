So uh this code is kinda messy....
The mathstuff class,  and the find target, adjust to target, and adjust to distance commands are the important ones.
There is stuff in Robot that needs to be brought over and the motors currently are spark maxes not falcons. (No time and drivetrain wasn't done at time of coding)
