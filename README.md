# 2022 Robockets Master

## Rapid React Programming

I give you, the labor of 5 different programmers!
There are quite some features in this build that did not exist previously

## Features
- Modify the Operator Interface on Shuffleboard! Choose between 2 controllers, 1 controller, and button board
- A limelight that actually works!
- All motors have ramp up to them, which keeps the robot from jittering
