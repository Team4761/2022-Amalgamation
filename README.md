# 2022-Amalgamation
An amalgamation of everyone's code. To be turned into one project!

This is the current Master Code file

As of right now the code builds correctly although there are some things to tweak as testing moves foward,
espeicially with the shooter stuff but we can't really figure it out until testing is moving foward.

The vendordeps have two JSON files needed for compilation, the rest is just the src files not the whole project.
